"""LangGraph client-tools graph.

The browser declares the tools (get_weather/weather_card/confirm_booking) and
ships them to the model as the AG-UI client tool catalog; ag-ui-langgraph
merges them into state['tools']. This graph binds those client stubs onto the
model (no server implementation) and ends the turn when the model calls one —
the browser executes it and re-runs with a ToolMessage, which the model then
summarizes.
