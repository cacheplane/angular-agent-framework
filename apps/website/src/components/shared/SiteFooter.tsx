 * Route gate for the marketing footer.
 *
 * The footer is mounted once in the root layout, so every route gets it unless
 * something opts out here. The docs tree opts out: every /docs route renders
 * the sidebar control plane and ends at its own prev/next rail, and a marketing
 * footer bolted under that column breaks the single-pane reading experience.
 * The homepage keeps the footer but drops its newsletter form: the field
 * report form is the homepage's one form (spec §3, block 6), so a second
 * capture form in the footer would just duplicate it.
