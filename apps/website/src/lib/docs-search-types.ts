/**
 * Wire types shared by the search route and the client dialog.
 *
 * This module imports nothing on purpose. `DocsSearchHit` would naturally sit
 * beside `searchIndexedDocs`, but that file's dependency chain reaches
 * `lib/docs.ts` and therefore `fs`. A type-only import is erased at build
 * time, so it would work — right up until someone drops the `type` keyword
 * and pulls Node built-ins into the client bundle. Keeping the types here
 * removes that trap rather than commenting on it.
