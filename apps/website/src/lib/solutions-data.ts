/**
 * Solutions pages are hand-written, not templated at scale.
 *
 * This file drives `/solutions/[slug]`, which makes it look like a page
 * generator. It is not one, and it must not become one. Google's
 * scaled-content-abuse policy targets exactly this shape: families of
 * programmatically generated pages that differ only by keyword.
 *
 * The rule: every entry must carry genuinely distinct first-hand content —
 * a real problem we have seen, a real architecture, real code. If a new
 * entry would amount to a find-and-replace of an existing one (swap the
 * vertical noun, keep the structure and the claims), do not add it. Write a
 * blog post or a docs guide instead, where the thing you actually have to
 * say can stand on its own.
 *
 * "Real code" is a required field, not an aspiration: `code` must be a working
 * snippet against the published API, and each entry's snippet must show a
 * DIFFERENT part of the stack from its siblings. Two entries that both reduce
 * to "call interrupt(), then approve it" are the find-and-replace this rule
 * exists to prevent, however different their prose is.
 *
 * `solutions-data.spec.ts` enforces what can be enforced mechanically —
 * unique proof-point markers, a distinct code snippet per entry. The
 * editorial judgement above is still yours.
 *
 * Adding an entry is an editorial decision, not a data-file edit.
 *
 * See https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/ai-optimization-guide
